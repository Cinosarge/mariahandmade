An e-commerce for handmade products developed for the Web Course at University of Salerno. It does not meet any security requirements for an e-commerce (and any security standard at all) and has to be considered for didactical use only.

## Purpose
You may use this project either as a consistent J2EE example (it also include some basic code to upload images to the website) or as an goat to simulate any kind of attack.
