# ðŸ›’ mariahandmade
This project had been developed for the Web Course at University of Salerno. It's an e-commerce for handmade products. It does not meet the security requirements for a real e-commerce and is to be considered for didactical use only.

## Purpose
You may use this project either as a consistent JavaEE web project example (it also includes some basic code to upload images to the website) or as a scapegoat to search for vulnerabilities and make some hacks.

## Importing the project
This is a JavaEE 8 compliant Web Application. I suggest to use the following configuration for a straightforward project import:
+ Use Tomcat 8.5
+ Use JavaSE version 8
+ Use Eclipse IDE for Java Developers version 2020-06 (this version runs on Java 8)
+ Use DBeaver to operate upon the SQLite database

Importing the project under Windows
+ Extract the "enricosbrighi" folder contained within "sbrighienrico.rar" and put it under C:/
+ Import the project inside "mariahandmade" to Eclipse IDE

Importing the project under other OSs
+ You need to make small changes to the hardcoded paths inside the code.
